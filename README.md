# react-native-whatsapp-status-downloader
A react native app for downloading whatsapp status

I decied to create this app when my friend posted a very funny video on his whatsapp status.

Whatsapp status files is located in /Whatsapp/media/.statuses directory

This project crawls throught the directory with the help of `react-native-fetch-blob`

Running locally <br />
``` git clone https://github.com/raheemazeezabiodun/react-native-whatsapp-status-downloader.git  ``` <br />
``` cd react-native-whatsapp-status-downloader```<br />
``` npm install```

create a [fabric](https://fabric.io) api key for handling crashes and add it to `Android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file

Bundle the apk together with `npm run bundle-android`

You can star this project if you like it, i don't mind the attention ....
